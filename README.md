# Zero Death: A Text-Based RPG Game

## Overview:
Zero Death is a turn-based text adventure RPG game developed during my first year of college. It is designed to be accessible through the Command-Line Interface (CLI) and offers players an immersive gaming experience reminiscent of classic role-playing games.

## Gameplay:
In Zero Death, players embark on a journey through the cursed "Deastle", formerly a thriving castle now plagued by a dark curse. The goal is to navigate through ten floors, each guarded by formidable monsters known as "Flonsters". Players must defeat these Flonsters, unlock treasure chests, and progress to higher levels of the castle. In the unfortunate event of your character's demise, you'll lose all your items, progress, and must restart from scratch. This means returning to the main menu and embarking on your adventure anew, facing the cursed "Deastle" once more.

## Key Features:
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Engage in strategic turn-based battles with Flonsters, where every decision counts.
- **Character Customization:** Customize your character's name and equipment as you progress through the game.
- **Exploration:** Explore the depths of the "Deastle", encountering challenges, treasures, and secrets along the way.
- **Inventory Management:** Manage your inventory carefully, collecting potions and powerful weapons to aid you in your quest.
- **ASCII Art:** Enjoy visually engaging ASCII art depicting characters, monsters, and environments throughout the game.

## How to Play:
1. **Launch the Game:** Open the Command-Line Interface and navigate to the directory containing the game files.
2. **Start the Game:** Run the game executable file to begin your adventure.
3. **Navigate the Menus:** Use the keyboard to navigate through menus and make decisions.
4. **Explore the Map:** Choose actions such as shopping, exploring, resting, or engaging in combat as you progress through the castle floors.
5. **Defeat Flonsters:** Battle "Flonsters" in turn-based combat to unlock the next floor and reap rewards.
6. **Manage Inventory:** Collect potions and upgrade your weapons to improve your chances of survival.
7. **Survive or Perish:** Make strategic choices to stay alive and conquer the cursed Deastle, or meet your demise and face eternal banishment.
